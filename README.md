A python + tkinter implementation of digitally signing files.

## The background

Digital signatures are like ink signatures but for digital documents. They use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for high security. You need an electronic signature app to use them. Once signed, the document canâ€™t be altered, making it secure and valid worldwide.
